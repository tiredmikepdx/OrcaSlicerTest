            ## ‚ùå DCO Check Failed

            This pull request has commits that are not signed off with the
            Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).

            ### How to fix this:

            1. **For new commits**: Use the \`-s\` flag when committing:
               \`\`\`bash
               git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
               \`\`\`

            2. **For existing commits**: Amend them with sign-off:
               \`\`\`bash
               # For the last commit
               git commit --amend -s --no-edit

               # For multiple commits (replace N with number of commits)
               git rebase --signoff HEAD~N
               \`\`\`

            3. **Force push** your changes:
               \`\`\`bash
               git push --force-with-lease
               \`\`\`

            ### What is DCO?

            The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for
            contributors to certify that they have the right to submit their
            contribution under the project's license. Please read our
            [DCO file](../DCO) and
            [Contributing Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
            for more information.

            This DCO framework was integrated from
            TengerTechnologies-Bricklayers to ensure proper governance and
            legal compliance for contributions.
